    <p>AQS News ("we", "our", or "us") operates the AQS News mobile application (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our App.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Our App is a news aggregation application. We do not require user registration or login to use the App. We do not collect, store, or share any personal identifiable information (PII) from our users.</p>

    <p>We do not collect log data or usage analytics from the App.</p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>Our App does not use cookies or similar tracking technologies.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our App may display news content sourced from publicly available information. We do not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>

    <h2>Network Access</h2>
    <p>The App requires internet access to retrieve news content. The only network requests made by the App are to fetch publicly available news data. No personal information is transmitted during these requests.</p>
